# Univariate and Bivariate Analysis of International Social Survey Program (ISSP) analysed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 

# Introduction
Using the ISSP (2024)[^1] for Social Inequality I-V – Cumulation in Great Britain we can analyse the relationship between education, culture and social class over time, from 1987 to 2019. SPSS can prove as a statistical tool to assit answering the research question: *Both education systems and culture are tools for upper class domination of the lower classes, as Bourdieu asserts. How convincing is this claim in Britain today?*

## Reseach Question

**RQ1**: Is there a relationship between economic capital (v1) and social class (v60)? 
**RQ2**: Is there a relationship between culturual capital (v59) and social class (v60)?
**RQ3**: Is there a relationship between social capital (v7) and social class (v60)?
**RQ4**: Is there a relationship between education systems (v2, v3) and social class (v60)? 
**RQ5**: Are education and culture tools for upper class domination of the lower classes (v20, v60)? 

## Rationale

The claim that the education system and class-based inequality are tightly bound has been repeatedly proven in Sociology of Education (Giddens, 2021:585). The French Sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu (1930 – 2002) used empirical data combined with phenomenological influences to research the connection between the upper classes domination over lower classes to investigate culture and education as mechanisms of domination. This essay will examine the extent to which Bourdieu’s claim is applicable to the current British education system. The following paragraphs establish how [*cultural reproduction*](#cultural-reproduction) in the [*field*](#field) of education favours the [*habitus*](#habitus) of individuals with high [*cultural capital*](#Capital:-economic,-social-&-cultural). Further it will discuss how this is reinforced by *symbolic violence* against individuals with low cultural capital resulting in the transference of the undervalued cultural capital through habitus generationally. There are limitations to Bourdieu’s framework when using it directly to research Britain today, thus recent research has adapted his concepts and methodology to fit the context of increasing immobility and a new class system.

## Theorectical Background 

### Field 

Bourdieu’s (cited in Dillon, 2020:397) theory of education as a ‘field’ demonstrates how income inequality is a key factor to the unequal allocation of school funding since budgets are determined by public and private investments driven by political and economic fields. Field theory is concerned with a particular social environment where individuals compete in the ‘game’ for hierarchical positions (Inglis, 2019:203). For Bourdieu (cited in Inglis, 2020:209), education is the most important field as it represents the upper classes and lower classes competing against each other, statistics repeatedly prove the upper class are more successful in the education system (Reay cited in Inglis, 2020:209). State schools in Britain, especially in deprived areas, have fewer resources to ‘level the playing field’ between the upper and lower classes (Jerrim & Macmillan, 2015). Each field has ‘nomos’, specific rules and social norms. The nomos of a field are decided by those with high hierarchical positions in the field (Fowler, 1997:58). In Scotland, Riddell (2009) found that disadvantaged pupils were disproportionately diagnosed with learning and behavioural difficulties, additionally, these disadvantaged children do not receive the extra support they need.

### Capital: economic, social & cultural

This evidence shows pupils from lower classes are seen as misbehaving and ill-mannered, thus subordinate for not adhering to the nomos. Whilst those from upper- and middle-class backgrounds move through education with the ‘correct’ manners and fewer difficulties in learning (Giddens, 2021:589). In Giddens’ view, capital consists of economic (summation of one’s wealth), social (quality and quantity of social connections) and cultural capital, which can be exchanged within a field. This capital can be broken down into embodied (physical and mental actions representing culture), objectified (stock of cultural resources, such as, books, art, music) and institutional (qualifications, years of schooling) (Bourdieu 1986:243 cited in Dillon, 2020:295). 

### Cultural Reproduction 

Cultural reproduction serves as a cyclical mechanism which passes on certain cultural practices within the education system (Jægar & Breen’s, 2016). Due to insufficient public funding, these allocation disparities reinforce cultural reproduction. Knowing the nomos of a field can be acquired through cultural capital. Children with learning difficulties from the upper classes exchange economic and social capital to send their children to private schools or personal tutors, where they will be granted additional support, returning cultural capital (Giddens, 2021:593). Inglis (2019:199) offers the criticism that Bourdieu relies too heavily on the macro as causation for inequality in the educational field, rather than individual circumstances. Nevertheless, nomos are determined by those with high positions in the field, who gained them through quality educational attainment and possession of cultural capital. Thus, the upper class are inevitably at an advantage when playing the game (Dillion, 2020:401). Bourdieu’s concept of field provides a macro understanding of how education systems and cultural reproduction remain a tool for domination in Britain today. 

### Habitus 

To further support his claim, Bourdieu complements macro field theory with a micro perspective of ‘habitus’. (Dillion, 2020:409). Our embodied and internalised view of our social world, including ways of speaking, thinking, dressing etc., is considered our ‘habitus’, acquired through our surroundings (Dillon, 2020:412;Giddens, 2021:589). As previously indicated, Bourdieu (cited in Jægar & Breen, 2016) stated that individuals from lower economic backgrounds were transferred lower forms of cultural capital through primary habitus which directly impacted success in education. Hence, the upper class have the unconscious dispositions to succeed in education. The Scottish Government’s Curriculum for Excellence (2008) transmits knowledge that is already embodied and objectified by the middle class. This puts the working class at a disadvantage (Bourdieu and Passeron, 1990).  Primary habitus is defined as the cultural capital to which a parent has access, and can choose to transfer onto their children in early years. While secondary habitus is accumulated over one’s lifetime outside the family, for example, education (Wacquant, 1992). Critics of Bourdieu point that he provides no clear behavioural framework for how parents decide which knowledge is passed down (Xu and Hampden- Thompson 2012). Jægar & Breen’s (2016) dynamic model of cultural reproduction provides an up-to-date understanding of how primary habitus is used as a tool for upper class domination in Britain today. Their formulation gives a quantitative perspective on how parental socio-economic background greatly affects the types of investment a child receives. Consequently, people from similar socio-economic backgrounds share similar habitus (Dillion, 2020:402). Evidence in the section above validates the impact of primary habitus on the child’s knowledge in a field. The limitations of Bourdieu’s claim have been re-examined and re-adjusted by contemporary sociologists, providing a more comprehensive explanation for how habitus links cultural reproduction to an education system with class-based inequality.

These variables were chosen as they show across all years in the data. v7 can be used to measure social capital, while v1 can be used to 

------------------------------

Both variables are *ordinal* therefore a *crosstabulation* will be conducted. It could go both ways, democracy could influence womenrights;womenrights could influence democracy.

> **Independent variable:** democracy
> 
> **Dependent variable:** Social Class

**Null Hypothesis H0:** There is no significant relationship economic capital (v1) and social class (v60).
**Alternative Hypothesis H1:** There is a significant relationship between economic capital (v1) and social class (v60).

| 10    | (An essential characteristic of democracy)                    | 

**Value Recoded:** womenrights was recoded from 10 categories into 5 categories (Not essential, Somewhat essential,
Moderately essential, Very essential, An essential characteristic). This was done to give a more concise view of the answers, however not distilling it into too few categories which would lose nuance.
